## My optimistic plan is the following:

1. **Port to 1.20**  
   1.1 Use a basic template and port across all existing functionality that I can.

2. **Add New Villager AI**

   2.1 **Guard**  
    - Equip gold
    - Equip bow, alongside new archer guard post. Guards with bows will only go to archery guard posts and vice versa. Guards should decide whether to equip bow or sword based on the guard posts (and availability). Levels should increase accuracy, starting with very poor aim (otherwise massively OP). Training equipment should also be added (i.e., a target).
    - Add horse riding
    - Separate the skill levels if possible

   2.2 **Blacksmith**  
    - Add gold armor
    - Add horse armor

   2.3 **Add Fletcher**  
    - Makes bows and arrows

   2.4 **Add Baker**  
    - Makes baked goods (excluding baked potatoes)

   2.5 **Add Fisherman**  
    - Fishes fishes at fishing spots (should prefer piers or something)

   2.6 **Add Stonemason**

   2.7 **Enchanter**  
    - Add Enchants gold and golden apples

   2.8 **Farmer**  
    - Add all crop types  (within reason)
    - Add composting

   2.9 **Rancher**  
    - Adds a horse and mule rancher role

   2.10 **Add Beekeeper**
    - plants flowers and harvests honey

   2.11 **Add Librarian**  
    - Wanders around the library, boosts adult education

   2.12 **Architect and Profession**  
    - Add schedule. Go to tavern with everyone else. Require a bed.

   2.13 **Add Cartographer**
    - Makes paper, maps, etc.

3. **Bug Fixes**  
   - Lots and lots and lots and lots

4. **Add Capability for Multiple Stores**  
   - Villagers use the closest store first.

5. **Add an Infinite Bed Option**  
   - Add  very expensive unlimited beds option (if technically feasible).

### Explore:

6. **Crop Signage**  
   - Instead of planting to indicate what you want there, use fences and signs.
7. **Multiple Floor Levels for buildings**
8. **Ladder Climbing Capability**
9. **Escape from Water Capability**
10. **Use of Lava Pit as Rubbish Disposal**
11. **Domestic Animal Interactions for Children**
12. **City hall upgrade i.e., greater boundaries**
13. **Prioritise using roads/paths over crossing grass etc.**
14. **Add ability to allocate bed to individuals/certain workers**
15. **Constrain Golems**
16. **Add animal petting for happiness?**
17. **Custom Bard Music**
18. **Town Bell for Warning of Attacks. i.e. trigger guard action, trigger villager retreat to town hall/nearest building**
